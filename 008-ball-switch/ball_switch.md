# What is a Tilt Ball Sensor (Tilt Switch)?

A **tilt ball sensor** is a small device that acts like a **switch**, which **opens or closes depending on the angle it's tilted**.

---

## ⚙️ How Does It Work?

Inside the sensor, there’s a **metal ball** (or mercury blob) inside a hollow casing. On one end of the casing are **two metal contacts**.

- ✅ When the sensor is **tilted in a certain direction**, the ball **rolls down and touches both contacts**, **closing the circuit** (turning it ON).
- ❌ When tilted the other way, the ball **moves away from the contacts**, **opening the circuit** (turning it OFF).

## 🧠 Why Does This Exist?

It provides a **simple and cheap** way to detect tilt or orientation without needing complex sensors or software.

## 🧪 Tilt Sensor vs. Accelerometer

| Feature            | Tilt Ball Sensor       | Accelerometer                    |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Detects tilt       | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes                           |
| Detects angle      | ❌ No (just ON/OFF)     | ✅ Yes (precise values)          |
| Cost/Complexity    | 💰 Cheap & Simple       | 💻 Expensive & Needs Code        |
| Output type        | ON/OFF (binary)        | Analog or Digital signal         |

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

- 🎮 **Toys** – Light up or trigger sounds when tilted.
- ☕ **Appliances** – Auto shut-off for devices like kettles when knocked over.
- 🔐 **Anti-theft** – Trigger alarm if something is moved.
- 🧍 **Fall detection** – Basic detection in wearable devices.
- 📦 **Shipping safety** – Alert if a package is flipped upside down.

## 🧭 Analogy

> Imagine a marble inside a tube:
> - If you tilt the tube, the marble rolls to one end and presses a button – that’s the **ON state**.
> - If it rolls away, the button is released – that’s the **OFF state**.
