# 📡 What is an Ultrasonic Sensor?

An **ultrasonic sensor** is a device that uses sound waves to **measure distance** between the sensor and an object. It's widely used in projects for **distance sensing** and **obstacle avoidance**.

## 🔍 Overview

The most commonly used model is the **HC-SR04**, which is:

- 💰 **Inexpensive**
- ⚙️ **Easy to use**
- 📚 **Well-supported with libraries**

It works by **sending out an ultrasonic pulse** and measuring the **time it takes for the echo to return** — similar to how bats navigate using echolocation.

## 📏 Typical Use Cases

- 🚗 Obstacle avoidance in robots
- 📐 Distance measurement tools
- 🛑 Automated object detection
- 🏠 Smart parking systems

---

## 💡 Key Features of HC-SR04

- Range: ~2 cm to 400 cm
- Accuracy: ±3 mm
- Uses: **Trigger** and **Echo** pins for control and reading
- Requires 5V power

## ⚠️ Note

A specific **Ultrasonic library** is often used to simplify coding with the HC-SR04, handling pulse timing and calculation automatically.
